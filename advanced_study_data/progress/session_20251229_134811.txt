## 2. The 5 Most Important Facts to Memorize

1. **Lisbon Treaty (2009)** fundamentally reformed EU institutional structure, creating the permanent President of the European Council and strengthening the European Parliament's role.

2. **Ordinary Legislative Procedure** (formerly co-decision) requires approval from both the European Parliament and the Council of the EU for most legislation.

3. **Principle of Subsidiarity** dictates that the EU should act only when objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by member states individually.

4. **Four Fundamental Freedoms** of the Single Market: free movement of goods, services, capital, and persons.

5. **Qualified Majority Voting (QMV)** in the Council requires at least 55% of member states representing at least 65% of the EU population.

## 3. Common Misconceptions to Avoid

- **Misconception:** The European Commission alone creates EU laws.
  **Reality:** The Commission proposes legislation, but the Parliament and Council must adopt it.

- **Misconception:** The European Council and Council of the EU are the same institution.
  **Reality:** The European Council sets political direction (heads of state), while the Council of the EU legislates (ministers).

- **Misconception:** The EU has a constitution.
  **Reality:** The Constitutional Treaty was rejected; the Lisbon Treaty functions as a "reform treaty" without constitutional status.

- **Misconception:** All EU member states use the euro.
  **Reality:** Several countries (Denmark, Sweden, Poland, etc.) either have opt-outs or don't meet convergence criteria.

- **Misconception:** The European Parliament directly initiates legislation.
  **Reality:** Only the Commission has formal legislative initiative in most policy areas.

## 4. Connections to Other Topics in European Integration

- **European Integration II:** This exam's institutional knowledge forms the foundation for studying policy-making, enlargement, and external relations.
- **Comparative Federalism:** EU's multi-level governance system compares to federal states like Germany or the US.
- **International Organizations:** EU differs from traditional IOs through its supranational elements and direct effect of law.
- **Democratic Theory:** EU's "democratic deficit" debates connect to political theory courses.
- **European Law:** Understanding institutions is prerequisite for studying EU legal system and Court of Justice jurisprudence.

## 5. Practice Questions

### **Dual-Choice (True/False):**
1. The European Parliament has the power to formally initiate EU legislation. (False)
2. The Lisbon Treaty abolished the pillar structure of the European Union. (True)
3. All EU member states are automatically part of the Schengen Area. (False)

### **Multiple-Choice:**
4. **Which institution represents the interests of EU member states' governments?**
   a) European Commission
   b) European Parliament  
   c) Council of the European Union
   d) Court of Justice of the EU
   *Correct: c*

5. **The principle of "direct effect" means:**
   a) EU citizens can vote for the European Commission
   b) EU regulations apply immediately in member states without national implementation
   c) The European Council meets directly after Parliament sessions
   d) Member states can directly veto Commission proposals
   *Correct: b*

### **Short Answer:**
6. **Explain the difference between regulations and directives in EU law.**
   *Sample answer: Regulations are directly applicable in all member states without national implementation. Directives set objectives that member states must achieve through national laws within a specified timeframe, allowing flexibility in implementation methods.*

7. **Define "neofunctionalism" in one sentence.**
   *Sample answer: Neofunctionalism is a theory of European integration that posits integration in one technical sector creates functional pressures for integration in related sectors, leading to a "spillover" effect.*

## 6. Study Techniques Specific to This Material

### **For Institutional Knowledge:**
- **Create comparison tables** contrasting the composition, functions, and powers of different EU institutions.
- **Use acronym mnemonics:** For example, "CLEAR" for Commission characteristics: Collegiality, Legislative initiative, Executive functions, Appointment powers, Representation externally.

### **For Treaty Developments:**
- **Timeline visualization:** Create a chronological timeline of major treaties with 2-3 key changes per treaty.
- **"Before and After" exercises:** Contrast how decision-making worked before and after major reforms (e.g., Maastricht, Lisbon).

### **For Exam Format Preparation:**
- **Dual-Choice practice:** Convert your notes into true/false statements; practice identifying absolute vs. qualified claims.
- **Multiple-choice strategy:** Practice eliminating clearly wrong options first, then distinguishing between plausible alternatives.
- **Short-answer drilling:** Practice defining key terms in 2-3 sentences maximum, focusing on precision over comprehensiveness.

### **Active Recall Methods:**
- **Institutional role-playing:** Explain each institution's role as if you were that institution ("As the European Commission, my main responsibilities are...").
- **Concept mapping:** Create visual diagrams showing relationships between institutions, procedures, and policies.
- **Peer teaching:** Explain complex procedures (like the ordinary legislative procedure) to someone unfamiliar with the topic.

### **Time Management Simulation:**
- Take practice exams with strict 90-minute timing to build pacing awareness.
- Allocate time proportionally to point values, not question count.

**Final Exam Tips:**
1. Read all instructions carefully, noting point values per question.
2. Answer every question—even guesses on multiple-choice have statistical value.
3. In short answers, lead with the most important information since grading is often time-pressured.
4. Review dual-choice questions last; initial instincts are often correct.
5. Use all available time—review answers if finished early.

*Viel Erfolg bei der Prüfung!*
