  "summary": "This edited volume provides a detailed, multi-sector analysis of Switzerland's complex relationship with the European Union since the pivotal rejection of the European Economic Area (EWR) in 1992. It examines the subsequent 'bilateral path' as a strategy to achieve market integration while preserving national autonomy, highlighting its evolution, internal contradictions, and the persistent political tensions it generates. The book dissects how this relationship is shaped by domestic politics, direct democracy, and varying sectoral interests, culminating in the recent stalemate over an Institutional Framework Agreement.",
