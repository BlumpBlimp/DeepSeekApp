  "why_exam_relevance_high": "This document presents a sophisticated, theoretical framework for analyzing the EU's existential crises and resilience. It is directly relevant for advanced exams in European Studies, Political Science, and Public Policy, as it requires students to critique and apply major integration theories (e.g., historical institutionalism, state-building) to contemporary EU challenges. It moves beyond descriptive crisis narratives to offer an explanatory model for polity survival, a classic exam question format.",

  "summary": "The article argues that the EU, conceived as a novel 'compound polity,' proved unexpectedly resilient during the post-2008 'long crisis decade' despite severe foundational conflicts over sovereignty, solidarity, and identity. It develops a theoretical framework, adapting Rokkanian state-building theory, to explain this resilience not through traditional state capacity but through mechanisms like public rhetorical action, externalization, and the paradoxical strengths of its decentralized, fragmented structure. The authors view crises as primarily threatening, not functional, for integration.",
