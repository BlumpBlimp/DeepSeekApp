  "complexity": "Advanced",
  "key_concepts": [
    "Postfunctionalism (Hooghe & Marks): Politisierung, constraining dissensus, community-scale dilemma",
    "Polycrisis: Conceptualization as 'failures' vs. 'attacks' (Schimmelfennig), asymmetric/symmetric shocks",
    "Crisis Response Mechanisms: Fiskalföderalismus vs. Finanzmarktunion (de Grauwe), 'failing forward' (Jones et al.)",
    "New Intergovernmentalism: Role of de novo bodies (ESM, Frontex, EZB) bypassing politicization",
    "Schengen/Asylum Crisis: Dublin System, GEAS, Pact on Migration (2024), flexible solidarity",
    "Institutional Capacity Building: Limited but relevant (ESM, NextGenEU, Frontex, EUAA, European Peace Facility)",
    "Crisis Typology: Exogenous/endogenous, symmetrical/asymmetrical, slow/fast-burning (Boin et al.)",
    "Integration Outcome Synthesis: Preference convergence + low politicization → Integration; High politicization → Differentiation/Stagnation"

  "exam_relevance": "High",
  "reason": "The document provides a sophisticated, theory-driven analysis of the EU's most significant contemporary challenges (Euro, migration, Covid, security). It directly compares integration theories (LI, NF, Postfunctionalism) against real-world crisis responses—a classic advanced exam requirement. The material is structured around analytical frameworks (crisis typologies, theoretical explanations) rather than mere description, demanding critical application skills.",
  "likely_exam_questions": [
    "Comparative Theory Application: 'Explain the EU's response to the Euro crisis using Liberal Intergovernmentalism, Neofunctionalism, and Postfunctionalism. Which theory is most convincing and why?'",
    "Crisis Analysis: 'Analyze the Schengen crisis using Schimmelfennig's 'failures' vs. 'attacks' framework. To what extent was it a crisis of capacity versus identity?'",
    "Mechanism Evaluation: 'Compare and contrast the two insurance mechanisms for monetary unions (de Grauwe). Why was one favored during the Euro crisis and the other during Covid?'",
    "Concept Explanation: 'Define and illustrate 'constraining dissensus' and 'failing forward' with concrete examples from the polycrisis.'",
    "Synthesis Question: 'The document argues integration proceeds under preference convergence and low politicization. Assess this claim against the EU's crisis responses from 2009-2024.'"

  "summary": "This seminar analyzes the EU's 'polycrisis' (2009-2025) through the lens of integration theory, particularly Postfunctionalism. It examines the Euro, Covid, Schengen, and security crises, highlighting how asymmetric shocks, politicization, and capacity deficits shaped EU responses characterized by 'new intergovernmentalism' and 'failing forward.' The document concludes that while the EU has built limited crisis-management capacity, fundamental tensions in the Euro and Schengen areas remain, with future integration likely involving further differentiation.",
