  "summary": "This chapter examines the EU's Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ), a policy domain that has rapidly moved from the periphery to the center of European integration. It highlights the tension between member states' desire for cooperation on cross-border issues like migration and crime and their reluctance to cede sovereignty in these core state functions. The analysis reveals a dominant mode of 'transgovernmental governance,' focused on operational coordination between national authorities rather than deep legal harmonization, and underscores the limits of political unification exposed by crises like the 2015 migration emergency.",
