It details specific agreements, legal principles, and political tensions that are classic exam topics for advanced seminars on European integration and Swiss foreign policy. The material includes treaty articles, case law, and comparative analysis of institutional alternatives—all typical fodder for essay and analytical questions.",

    "Analyze the political and legal safeguards available to Switzerland (PFZ) and an EEA member (Art. 112 EWR) to restrict free movement. How do they differ in theory and practice?",
    "Evaluate the two main alternatives to Switzerland's current bilateral path: a 'deep' free trade agreement (UK model) and EEA membership (Norwegian model). Discuss the implications for sovereignty and market access.",

  "summary": "This seminar document analyzes the two central pillars of Switzerland's bilateral relationship with the EU: trade in goods and the free movement of persons. It details the complex web of sectoral agreements governing trade (from the 1972 FTA to technical barriers and public procurement) and contrasts this bilateral model with the EU's single market and EEA membership. Simultaneously, it provides an advanced overview of the EU's free movement principle, tracing its legal evolution from an economic worker right to a citizenship right and its subsequent political backlash, highlighting key ECJ cases and their relevance for Switzerland's own agreement.",
