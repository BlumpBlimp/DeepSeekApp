      "why": "The book addresses a central and enduring tension in EU studies—how to manage unity and diversity among member states. This is critical for understanding current EU crises (e.g., euro, migration, Brexit), institutional developments, and treaty changes. It provides essential theoretical frameworks for analyzing real-world EU policy and politics."

      "Compare and contrast the concepts of 'multi-speed Europe' and 'core Europe' as models of differentiated integration.",

      "How has the mechanism of 'Enhanced Cooperation' been used in practice, and what are its limitations?",

      "Discuss the role of treaty reform in managing the tension between integration and differentiation."

    "summary": "This text provides a systematic examination of how the European Union balances the push for deeper integration with the reality of member state diversity through mechanisms of differentiation. It connects theoretical frameworks from political science with concrete policy areas and legal instruments. The analysis is crucial for understanding the EU's adaptive capacity and its future trajectory amid enlargement and internal crises."
