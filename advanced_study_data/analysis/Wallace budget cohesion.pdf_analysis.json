      "why": "The document covers a core public administration/finance topic that bridges theory (cohesion frameworks) and practice (budget implementation). It is highly likely to appear in exams focusing on public policy, fiscal management, or administrative reform, as it tests understanding of integration, coordination, and strategic alignment in governance."

    "summary": "The document presents Wallace's framework for understanding budgetary cohesion, which is the degree of alignment and consistency within a government's budget system. It breaks cohesion down into three key dimensions: vertical (hierarchical alignment), horizontal (cross-sectoral coordination), and temporal (multi-year consistency). Mastering this concept is crucial for analyzing the effectiveness and sustainability of public financial management."
