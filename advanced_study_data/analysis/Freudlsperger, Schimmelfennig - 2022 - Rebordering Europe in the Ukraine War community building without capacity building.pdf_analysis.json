  "exam_relevance": "High",
  "reason": "This article presents a cutting-edge theoretical framework (bordering analysis) applied to a current, major geopolitical crisis (Ukraine War). It directly engages with core debates in EU studies (polity formation, integration theory, crisis response) and challenges established bellicist theories of state-building. For an advanced exam, it tests the ability to apply abstract concepts (boundary formation) to empirical events, critique theoretical expectations, and understand the unique nature of the EU as a polity.",

  "summary": "The article analyzes the EU's response to the Russo-Ukrainian war through a 'bordering' lens. It finds that the EU has engaged in significant *community building* by closing its boundaries with Russia and opening them to Ukraine, primarily through regulatory means. However, this has not been matched by equivalent *capacity building*—centralization of authority or resources for boundary control—contrary to bellicist theories of state formation. The EU's response thus reinforces its character as a 'regulatory state' rather than triggering a transformative shift towards a more state-like polity.",
