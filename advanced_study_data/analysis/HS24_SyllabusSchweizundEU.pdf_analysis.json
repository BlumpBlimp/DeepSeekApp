    "Foundational understanding of International Relations and Comparative Politics.",

  "summary": "This advanced seminar syllabus examines the complex relationship between Switzerland and the European Union by first establishing a deep understanding of the EU as a political system and project of integration. It then systematically applies this knowledge to analyze the history, logic, and key policy areas of the Swiss-EU bilateral path. The course culminates in assessing current challenges and future scenarios, framed by integration theory and contemporary crises.",
