  "reason": "This is a core theoretical and policy-focused textbook on the EU, directly addressing major integration theories and key policy areas. It is structured for advanced academic study, includes self-test questions, and synthesizes contemporary debates (e.g., polycrisis, Brexit, disintegration).

    "Evaluate the utility of 'differentiated integration' as a concept for understanding the EU's response to crises.",
    "To what extent does postfunctionalism challenge the traditional theories of European integration?",
    "Analyze the causes and consequences of differentiation in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice.",
    "Assess the role of ideas vs. material interests in shaping Economic and Monetary Union, using constructivist and intergovernmentalist perspectives.",
    "‘Differentiation is a persistent feature, not a bug, of European integration.’ Discuss."

  "prerequisites": [
    "Basic knowledge of EU institutions (Commission, Council, Parliament, Court).",
    "Understanding of key historical milestones in European integration.",

  "summary": "This advanced textbook provides a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of integration and differentiation in the European Union. It structures its analysis around four core theories—Intergovernmentalism, Supranationalism, Constructivism, and Postfunctionalism—and applies them to key EU policy areas: the Single Market, EMU, Security/Defence, and the AFSJ. The central argument is that differentiation (varied levels of integration among member states) is a persistent and structural feature of the EU, shaped by the interplay of these theoretical logics.",
