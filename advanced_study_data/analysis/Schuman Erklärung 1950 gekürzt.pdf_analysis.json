  "exam_relevance": "High",
  "why": "This is a foundational primary source document for understanding the origins of the European Union. It outlines the core philosophy (peace through economic interdependence), the specific mechanism (ECSC), and the long-term federal vision. Exams on European integration, post-WWII history, or international relations theory will almost certainly reference it. It provides the rationale for the entire EU project.",
  "likely_exam_questions": [
    "Analyze the Schuman Declaration as a blueprint for European integration. What were its immediate goals and its long-term vision?",
    "Explain how the Schuman Plan sought to make war between France and Germany 'not only unthinkable but materially impossible'.",
    "Compare and contrast the supranational 'High Authority' proposed in the declaration with a traditional intergovernmental organization.",
    "Discuss the significance of choosing coal and steel as the first sectors for integration.",
    "To what extent did the Schuman Declaration represent a new approach to securing peace in post-war Europe?",
    "Evaluate the declaration's argument that economic integration (a 'common market') would naturally lead to political community ('federation')."

  "summary": "The Schuman Declaration, delivered on 9 May 1950 by French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman, proposed placing French and German coal and steel production under a common High Authority, open to other European nations. This revolutionary act aimed to make war between the historic rivals materially impossible by intertwining their key war industries. It envisioned this concrete economic solidarity as the first step toward a broader European Federation, establishing peace through supranational integration rather than mere treaties between states.",
