It establishes a three-dimensional analytical framework (institutional depth, sectoral breadth, territorial expansion) for understanding integration dynamics. The material connects historical milestones with current EU structures and introduces the Swiss-EU relationship as a case study of differentiated integration. Key emphasis is placed on crisis-driven development and the evolution from sectoral to comprehensive integration.",
