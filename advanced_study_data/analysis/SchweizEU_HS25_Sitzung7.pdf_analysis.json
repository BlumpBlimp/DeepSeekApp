  "why": "This document provides a structured chronology of the core political and legal relationship between Switzerland and the EU, which is a central and complex topic in Swiss European policy seminars. It covers foundational treaties, critical junctures (like the 1992 EWR rejection), and the latest developments (Bilaterale III, 2024). Understanding the evolution, institutional mechanisms (e.g., Guillotine clauses, dispute settlement), and current negotiation challenges is essential for analyzing Swiss foreign policy and its unique model of integration.",

    "Compare and contrast the institutional provisions of the failed Framework Agreement (InstA) with those of the new 'Bilaterale III' package. Focus on dispute settlement, dynamic legal adaptation, and the Guillotine principle.",
    "Analyze the significance of the 1992 rejection of EEA membership. What were the main arguments of the debate, and how did this decision shape the subsequent bilateral path?",
    "Explain the concept and function of the 'Guillotine Clause' in the Bilateral I agreements. Why was it a point of contention, and how has its application evolved?",
    "Discuss the role of direct democracy (referendums) in shaping Switzerland's relationship with the EU, using specific examples from the document."

It concludes with an analysis of the failed Framework Agreement (InstA) and the key features of the new negotiation package 'Bilaterale III' (2024), highlighting shifts in institutional design and dispute resolution.",
