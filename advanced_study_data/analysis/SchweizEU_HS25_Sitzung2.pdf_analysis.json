    "Supranational vs. Intergovernmental Methods",

  "exam_relevance": "High",
  "reason": "This document covers the core constitutional architecture of the EU, which is foundational for any advanced exam on European integration. It details the powers, composition, and interactions of the main institutions—essential for analyzing EU policymaking, legitimacy debates (democratic deficit), and the unique nature of the EU as a political system. The comparison of decision-making methods (Community vs. intergovernmental) is a classic exam topic.",
  "likely_exam_questions": [
    "Compare and contrast the 'Community method' and the 'intergovernmental method' of EU decision-making, using specific examples of policy areas where each applies.",
    "Analyze the role of the European Commission. To what extent does it act as a 'supranational' actor promoting the 'Community interest'?",
    "Discuss the concept of the EU's 'democratic deficit.' Which institutional features of the EU political system contribute to this perception, and which might mitigate it?",
    "Explain the procedure and political significance of the 'investiture' of the European Commission by the European Parliament.",
    "Describe the composition and functions of the European Council. How has its role evolved, and how does it interact with the Council of the EU and the Commission?",
    "How does the system of Qualified Majority Voting (QMV) in the Council of the EU balance the principles of state equality and citizen equality?",
    "Essay: 'The EU is neither a classic federation nor a traditional international organization.' Evaluate this statement by analyzing its institutional structure and decision-making processes."

  "difficulty_spikes": [
    "Precise distinction and practical application of the 'Community method' vs. 'intergovernmental method' based on the three criteria (Commission initiative, Parliament role, Council voting rule).",
    "Understanding the nuanced and limited powers of the European Parliament (e.g., 'limited control function,' 'functional interests') within the institutional balance.",
    "Conceptualizing the EU's system of separation of powers, which differs fundamentally from nation-state models (e.g., Commission as executive but not a government, shared legislative power).",
    "The dual role of the Council of the EU as a legislative body (often QMV) and the key body for CFSP (unanimity)."
  ],
  "prerequisites": [
    "Basic knowledge of the history of European integration (e.g., founding treaties, key enlargements).",
    "Understanding of core political science concepts: separation of powers, federalism, intergovernmentalism, supranationalism.",
    "Familiarity with the general functions of a political system (interest aggregation, decision-making, implementation)."
  ],
  "summary": "This lecture outlines the core institutional framework of the European Union, analyzing it as a unique political system. It details the competences, composition, and interrelations of the five key institutions (Commission, Parliament, Council, European Council, Court of Justice), emphasizing the EU's hybrid nature. A central analytical framework is introduced, distinguishing decision-making processes based on the role of the Commission, Parliament, and the Council's voting rule, culminating in the contrast between the supranational 'Community method' and the intergovernmental method.",
