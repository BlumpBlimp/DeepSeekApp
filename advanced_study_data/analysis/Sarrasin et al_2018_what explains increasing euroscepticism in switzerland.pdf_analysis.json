  "exam_relevance": "High",
  "reason": "This document presents sophisticated longitudinal methodology (panel data analysis 1999-2014), tests competing theoretical frameworks (economic vs. political/cultural explanations), examines within-individual change (fixed-effects models), and focuses on a critical case study (Switzerland's unique EU relationship). It demonstrates advanced social science research design suitable for graduate-level exams in political sociology, European studies, or public opinion research.",
  "likely_exam_questions": [
    "Compare and contrast economic utilitarian vs. political/cultural explanations for Euroscepticism using the Swiss case",
    "Explain how longitudinal panel data with fixed-effects models advances our understanding of attitude change beyond cross-sectional studies",
    "Analyze why Switzerland represents a 'critical case' for studying Euroscepticism despite (or because of) its non-EU membership",
    "Discuss the 'winners vs. losers of globalization' framework and its application to EU support",
    "Evaluate the methodological strengths and limitations of using the Swiss Household Panel for studying political attitudes",
    "Explain the 'horseshoe model' of political ideology and EU attitudes, and why Switzerland deviates from this pattern",
    "How do the findings challenge or support Gabel's (1998) theory of comparative advantage in EU support?"

  "summary": "This longitudinal study analyzes increasing Swiss opposition to EU membership using Swiss Household Panel data (1999-2014). It tests economic (skills, financial situation) and political/cultural (right-wing ideology, political efficacy) explanations, finding that within-individual shifts toward right-wing ideology most strongly predict increased Euroscepticism. The research employs fixed-effects models to distinguish between-individual differences from within-individual change, advancing beyond cross-sectional analyses of EU attitudes.",
