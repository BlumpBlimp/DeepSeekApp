  "exam_relevance": "High",
  "reason": "This document covers core theoretical frameworks essential for analyzing European integration—a foundational topic in EU studies. It directly addresses central exam questions (why states integrate, conditions for success/failure) and provides comparative analytical tools (NF, LI, PF) crucial for advanced essay questions and case study analysis. The material is structured around key theorists and their causal mechanisms, which are typical exam fodder.",

    "Compare and contrast the explanations for European integration offered by Neofunctionalism and Liberal Intergovernmentalism.",
    "Analyze a recent EU crisis (e.g., Euro, migration, Brexit) through the lens of Postfunctionalism.",
    "Explain the concept of 'spill-over' and its different types. Provide examples.",
    "Discuss why, according to Liberal Intergovernmentalism, states voluntarily pool sovereignty.",
    "How does the 'permissive consensus' differ from the 'constraining dissensus,' and what are the implications for integration?",
    "Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of Differentiated Integration as a governance model for the EU.",
    "To what extent can the three theories (NF, LI, PF) explain the EU's responses to the polycrisis of the last 15 years?"

  "summary": "This document presents three dominant empirical theories of European integration: Neofunctionalism (integration driven by spill-over and supranational actors), Liberal Intergovernmentalism (integration as a series of state-led bargains), and Postfunctionalism (integration constrained by mass politics and identity). It frames them as tools to solve the central puzzle of why states voluntarily pool sovereignty, and contrasts their explanations for integration's progress, stagnation, or failure. The theories are evaluated for their ability to explain contemporary EU crises.",
