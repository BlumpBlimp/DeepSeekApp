  "exam_relevance": "High",
  "reason": "The material covers core, advanced political science theories (principal-agent, veto players, incomplete contracts) applied to a central EU institution (CJEU). It explains the dynamic, political role of the court in EU integration, a classic and frequently examined topic. Understanding why member states comply with CJEU rulings is fundamental to debates on EU sovereignty and legal integration.",

  "summary": "This chapter analyzes the CJEU not just as a legal institution but as a political actor. It introduces general theories of judicial politics, arguing that laws are 'incomplete contracts' granting courts discretionary power. It applies separation-of-powers and veto-player theories to explain the CJEU's significant influence in the EU's complex system. Finally, it explores specific theories explaining why sovereign states comply with the rulings of international courts like the CJEU, highlighting mechanisms like the preliminary ruling procedure.",
