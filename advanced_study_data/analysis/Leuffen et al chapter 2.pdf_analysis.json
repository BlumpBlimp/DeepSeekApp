    "summary": "This chapter outlines the major theoretical approaches to understanding European integration. It contrasts early theories like neofunctionalism and intergovernmentalism with more contemporary frameworks such as liberal intergovernmentalism and multi-level governance. The analysis highlights how these theories explain the drivers, processes, and limits of integration. Mastery of these concepts is crucial for critically analyzing the EU's political system and its evolution."
